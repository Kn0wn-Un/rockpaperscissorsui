[Rock Paper Scissors](https://kn0wn-un.github.io/rockpaperscissorsui/) 

### Introduction

We're going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic "rock paper scissors".  If you don't know what that is check the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) or [this](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors) ridiculous step-by-step.  For the moment we're just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit it and add a front end later so don't forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some 'view in browser' links in the student solutions - this is coming in a later lesson.  When you get there don't forget to come back and add your link!
